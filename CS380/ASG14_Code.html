        Hello, my name is Brad Ikerman. I really enjoy programming, and am looking forward to graduating next Summer. I am also currently working at Camber Corporation and have been wearing several hats in the software development groups. Currently, I am writing financial applications that allow for our contracts and accounting departments to access the check book and know exactly how much money they have, how much is left on the contract, and all the things that have been bought with that money. All of these Applications have been written in C# and have, so far, saved the company several hours of time! In my free time, I enjoy competition shooting, working on cars, and travel. Unfortunately, I haven't had too much time to complete either of the last two, but after this month I should be able to have more time for these hobbies.
