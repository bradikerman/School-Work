				<h2>Oak Wood Variety</h2>
				<p>Oak Wood is some of the strongest wood we sale. Coming in with a density of 0.75 g/cubic centimeter, <br>
				it is great for those projects that need the strength with a small space. One specific project is building <br>
				whiskey barrels. Oak has a high concentration of tannin which increases its resistance to insects and and <br>
				fungal attacks. Throughout history, Oak was used to build homes, ships, and storage containers. Today, <br>
				you can purchase these branches from us and enjoy building a durable, stable Oak Wood Project.</p>
				<p> Athens State University has been one of our prime customers. Below, you will see how some of our <br>
				Oak Branches have made it into the academic world. This is their current project to Build a Statue to <br>
				honor the University's tradition of the Fiddler's Convention held every October at <br>
				Athens State University.</p>
