	<h1>Various Aspects of Tennessee</h1>
	<p class="p1">
		Tennessee is one of my favorite states to visit. Not only is it known for it's history, but also for it's technological developments. Looking at Chattanooga, Nashville, and Memphis, these cities show the history of trade in the South as well as the culture of the land.

	<p class="p2">
		Chattanooga has become an IT hotspot in recent years. Spiceworks, a free application used for ticketing and network applications, recently held a seminar here to endorse it's product as well as meet "Spiceheads" from the South. The city, itself, was build as an industrial post. Being built on the Tennessee River, it allows for trade between the cities on the river and can be used as a port for those vessels.

		Memphis, located on the Mississippi River, has always been a sight to see. My wife and I especially like to visit Memphis to compare our photos from the base of the Mississippi River in New Orleans and Mobile all the way to Memphis where the barges and cargo boats are bringing in goods to distribute from even further South.

		Nashville is the capital of Tennessee and is one of my favorite places to visit. The Music, shows, and activites are always a pleasure! The Gaylord Hotel is one of my all time favorites, especially around Christmas. It is very well decorated and is an absolutely beautiful sight to see! I also enjoy walking into Downtown Nashville and hearing the music while enjoying a drink. Pretty awesome experience!

		Pidgeon Forge is also another one of my favorite spots to visiti in Nashville. It also holds a special place in my heart for where I asked, my now Wife, to marry me. In October of 2014, her family had invited me to join them for a weekend at the Christmas Inn. I greatfully agreed and had discussed my plan with her Father, who was super excited!

		Tennessee is one of my favorite states to visit. I could go on about other towns and places (specifically the Jack Daniel's Distillery), but we will save that for another time. The cities mentioned here do not do it justice and is all such a beautiful state to visit and enjoy!
