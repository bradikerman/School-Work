				<h2>Birch Wood Variety</h2>
				<p>We specialize in gray, white, black, silver, and yellow birch. All of these allow for your projects <br>
				to be completed in the best color and materials possible. Birch is known for having every piece of the <br>
				tree being utilized. Wind Turbines are one of the more popular uses in recent years. The light weight, <br>
				abundance, and fast growing nature of this tree allows for it to be a green solution to today's tough <br>
				environmental issues. This Tree also supports several forms of wildlife.<p>
